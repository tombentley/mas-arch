# [Template] ADR-00000 Defining a template for Architecture Decision Records
Authors: <!-- <authors names> -->

# Context and Problem Statement
<!-- Define the problem statement here. Be clear and succinct, you should be able to clearly define the context or problem in two or three paragraphs. Try to define the problem in the overall context of Managed Kafka and not to get into too much technical detail at this point. You should answer; if Managed Kafka does not address this issue/problem, the implications are the following….-->

# Goals
<!-- Clearly list the goals which this work will try to achieve-->
<!-- The goals should be achievable, not visionary statements -->

# Non-goals
<!-- This section is to help bound the work, where the goals identify what the arch overview hopes to achieve, this is the place to state clearly what isn’t in scope for this arch overview. It's as important as the goals to a degree -->

# Stakeholders
<!-- List the stakeholders here, i.e. what groups will be impacted by this arch overview, or if not impacted, ones which need to be made aware of it. E.g. BU, ENG, SRE, QE, Content Services (i.e. Docs), Other Workstream Areas (e.g. CI/CD, Service API)
<!-- If a stakeholder group is impacted, then they should review this document. See Section on Review Status for info on the review. -->

# Current Architecture
<!-- Specify the current approach here -->
<!-- In some cases, there isn’t an existing approach, e.g. the arch overview is for the addition of a new feature which currently doesn’t exist -->

# Proposed Architecture
<!-- Describe the proposed solution at a high level. The level of detail is at the discretion of the author, but as guidance, a person new to the document should be able to understand the problem and at a high level understand the approach to how that problem is going to be solved. If there were decisions/considerations that led to or influenced the proposed solution it can be helpful to call them out here to aid understanding. -->
<!-- Architecture diagrams should be included to help understand the proposal -->

# Threat Model
<!-- Provide a link to the relevant threat model. You must either update an existing threat model(s) to cover the changes made by this ADR, or add a new threat model.
Take a copy of the threat model when the ADR is proposed, and merge those changes in once the ADR is accepted -->


# Requires Architectural Overview Update
<!-- With a goal of keeping our living architectural docs upto date and ensuring the impact of a given ADR on a particular service architecture is well understood please provide a link to a Jira (with a task to update the architecture doc) or an updated section in an Architectural Overview doc. -->

# Alternatives Considered / Rejected
<!-- List the alternative approaches to the proposed architecture which have been evaluated / considered and provide details as to why they have been rejected in preferences to the proposed architecture. -->

# Challenges
<!-- Call out any challenges here, e.g. upskilling needed, specific resources needed (e.g. OpenShift cluster running on Azure), very aggressive timelines if known, etc  -->

# Dependencies
<!-- Any dependencies should be listed here, e.g. other dependent product releases -->
<!-- If the arch overview has potential impact on other workstreams, it should then be reviewed by people from that area. See review status section below, and associating Appendix, to identify who should review the arch overview. -->

# Consequences if Not Completed
<!-- Specify the consequences if this work is not completed -->
